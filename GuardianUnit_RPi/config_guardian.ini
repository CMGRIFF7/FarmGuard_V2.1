# This is the typical device path for a USB serial device on Linux.
# The ThingMagic USB Pro reader usually creates a serial port like /dev/ttyUSB0.
# You can check with 'ls /dev/ttyUSB*' after plugging in the reader.
reader_uri = tmr:///dev/ttyUSB0
# Optional: Set read power in centidBm (e.g., 2700 = 27.00 dBm, 3000 = 30.00 dBm)
# Consult reader documentation for max legal power in your region. Start lower and increase if needed.
# Max for USB Pro is often around 30 dBm (3000 cBdm) or 31.5 dBm with some models.
# read_power = 2700
# Optional: Set region (NA for North America, EU for Europe, etc.)
